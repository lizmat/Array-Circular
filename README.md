NAME
====

Array::Circular - add "is circular" trait to Arrays

SYNOPSIS
========

    use Array::Circular;

    my @a is circular(3);  # limit to 3 elements

DESCRIPTION
===========

This module adds a `is circular` trait to `Arrays`. This limits the size of the array to the given number of elements, similar to shaped arrays. However, unlike shaped arrays, you **can** `push`, `append`, `unshift` and `prepend` to arrays with the `is circular` trait. Then, if the resulting size of the array is larger than the given size, elements will be removed "from the other end" until the array has the given size again.

CAVEATS
=======

At this moment, it it only possible to specify the size of a circular array at compile time.
